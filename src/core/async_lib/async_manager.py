    Generic asynchronous task manager responsible for handling concurrent
    event processing using an internal asyncio.Queue.

    Responsibilities:
        - Manage an asyncio queue with optional max size.
        - Spawn and manage worker tasks.
        - Delegate item processing to an injected async handler.
        - Handle graceful shutdown and queue draining.

    This class is infrastructure-only and contains no business logic.

        queue (asyncio.Queue): Internal queue for event buffering.
        worker_count (int): Number of concurrent worker tasks.
        workers (list[asyncio.Task]): Active worker tasks.
        shutdown_event (asyncio.Event): Signal used for graceful shutdown.
