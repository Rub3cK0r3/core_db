My goals are to build a serious, backend-first, infrastructure-heavy system that I can deploy on Linux servers using CLI tools. I prioritize backend engineering, security relevance, and operational realism. Frontend is irrelevant. I explicitly do not care about web UI or graphics.

Environment:

* Linux (CLI-first)
* ThinkPad
* Sway
* tmux
* neovim

Priorities:

* Backend robustness
* Database integrity
* Security from day one (defense-oriented)
* Deployable with Docker / Kubernetes
* Enterprise-oriented metrics

Constraints:

* Everything runs from the terminal
* Full logs and audit trails
* Deployable and attackable in real scenarios
